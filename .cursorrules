# Godot 4.4 Game Development .cursorrules

## Core Development Guidelines

- Use strict typing in GDScript for better error detection and IDE support
- Implement _ready() and other lifecycle functions with explicit super() calls
- Use @onready annotations instead of direct node references in _ready()
- Prefer composition over inheritance where possible
- Use signals for loose coupling between nodes
- Follow Godot's node naming conventions (PascalCase for nodes, snake_case for methods)

## Version 4.3+ Compatibility Rules

### Binary Serialization
- Avoid relying on binary serialization for cross-version compatibility
- Test resource loading/saving with both old and new Godot versions

### TileMap Changes
- TileMap node is deprecated - use multiple TileMapLayer nodes instead
- Convert existing TileMaps using the TileMap bottom panel toolbox option "Extract TileMap layers"
- Access TileMap layers through TileMapLayer nodes
- Update navigation code to use TileMapLayer.get_navigation_map()
- Store layer-specific properties on individual TileMapLayer nodes
    
### Android Support
- Use OS.request_permission() for Android permissions
- Handle MainLoop.on_request_permissions_result signal
    
### Multiplayer
- Ensure server and client use same Godot version for multiplayer
- Implement version checking in multiplayer code

### Graphics
- Test decal colors after conversion to linear color space
- Update custom shaders for reverse Z depth buffer compatibility


## Performance Best Practices

- Use Node groups sparingly and prefer direct node references
- Implement object pooling for frequently spawned objects
- Use physics layers to optimize collision detection
- Prefer packed arrays (PackedVector2Array, etc.) over regular arrays
- Use occlusion culling for complex 3D scenes


## Resource Management

- Implement proper resource cleanup in _exit_tree()
- Use preload() for essential resources, load() for optional ones
- Consider PackedByteArray storage impact on backwards compatibility
- Implement resource unloading for unused assets


## Code Style

- Use type hints for all variables and function parameters
- Document complex functions with docstrings
- Keep methods focused and under 30 lines when possible
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Group related properties and methods together
- Use tabs for indentation instead of spaces


# Testing Guidelines

- Create automated tests for critical game systems
- Test on multiple platforms, especially for mobile deployment
- Implement debug modes for testing game mechanics
- Add logging for critical operations in release builds


## Scene Organization

- Keep scene tree depth minimal for better performance
- Use scene inheritance for reusable components
- Implement proper scene cleanup on queue_free()
- Use SubViewport nodes carefully due to performance impact
- Provide step-by-step instructions to create Godot scene(s) instead of providing scene source code


## Error Handling

- Implement graceful fallbacks for missing resources
- Use assert() for development-time error checking
- Log errors appropriately in production builds
- Handle network errors gracefully in multiplayer games


## Additional Instructions

1. Review the Godot 4.3 migration guide for breaking changes
2. Test thoroughly when upgrading from previous versions
3. Implement version checks for critical systems
4. Document any version-specific workarounds
5. Use version control for tracking project changes
6. Maintain compatibility with minimum supported hardware
7. Follow Godot's official style guide
